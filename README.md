# Multi-Factor Portfolio and Rolling Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a multi-factor portfolio using global equity indices and performing rolling analysis to dynamically assess the contributions of various factors to portfolio returns. The project includes a web-based dashboard to enable interactive portfolio analysis and modeling.

## Key Features:
#### Multi-Factor Portfolio Construction: Builds a portfolio using a set of global equity indices with custom weights.
#### Rolling Analysis: Implements rolling regression, correlation analysis, and variable selection to track time-varying factors influencing portfolio returns.
#### Factor Modeling: Decomposes returns using models like PCA, and tracks relevant factors over time.
#### Dashboard: A web-based interface to input asset allocations, re-run modeling, and visualize portfolio performance.
#### Backend Engine: Python-based calculations integrate with the database for real-time data manipulation and analysis.
